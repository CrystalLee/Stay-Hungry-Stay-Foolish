Based on an item consumed by the member, the algorithm computes other similar items (using an **item-item similarity matrix**) and returns the most similar items. Amongst the other algorithms, this one is unpersonalised as no other side features are utilised. However, it is personalised in the sense that it is a conscious choice to display a particular item’s similar items a member’s homepage (more details in Page Generation below).\n","\n","<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*J4BvJj1hBpg_nCeGmbH5Zw.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"1000\"/>\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ey5vEpS-ocsF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[20 Popular Machine Learning Evaluating Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/20-popular-machine-learning-metrics-part-1-classification-regression-evaluation-metrics-1ca3e282a2ce)\n","\n","1. **Classification** : Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC, …etc\n","2. **Regression** : MSE, MAE\n","3. **Ranking** : MRR, DCG, NDCG\n","4. **Statistical** : Correlation\n","5. **Computer Vision** : PSNR, SSIM, IoU\n","6. **NLP** : Perplexity, BLEU score\n","7. **Deep Learning Related** : Inception score, Frechet Inception distance\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zCib1fBEagBs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1196/0*AAS9hxEAJbh60Z0J.\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"1000\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"6azPjGaTeZNy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# NDCG\n","Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain"],"metadata":{"id":"gcjImytUySvm"}}]}
